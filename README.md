## ✨ Features ✨

- **Statically Typed 🔒:**  
  Catch errors early with a strict type system that prevents bugs and ensures reliability.
- **Interpreted Execution 🚀:**  
  Write and run code instantly without waiting for compilation.
- **Modern, Clean Syntax ✍️:**  
  Intuitive syntax designed for productivity and readability.
- **Fast Runtime ⚡:**  
  Powered by Rust for high-performance execution and low memory overhead.
- **First-Class Functions 🧠:**  
  Functions can be passed around as values, enabling functional programming styles.
- **Mutable and Immutable Variables 🛡️:**  
  Use `let` for immutable bindings and `var` for mutable ones.
- **Rich Standard Library 📚:**  
  Built-in support for working with numbers, strings, collections, and more.
- **Error Reporting 🎯:**  
  Clear and friendly runtime error messages.
- **REPL Mode 🧪:**  
  Test and experiment with your code interactively.
