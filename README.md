# ðŸŽ» Kaori - Programming Language

**Kaori** is a statically typed programming language, now implemented fully in **Rust**, previously implemented in Java 17

## Features

-   **Statically Typed**  
    Enforces type safety for predictable, and faster runtime

-   **Detailed Error Messages**  
    Developer-friendly diagnostics for syntax and runtime issues

-   **Implemented Language Features**

    -   [x] Variable declaration (`x: num = 10;`, `x: bool = true;`, `x: str = "Hello world";`)
    -   [x] Assign operator (`x = 5;`)
    -   [x] Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
    -   [x] Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
    -   [x] Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
    -   [x] Postfix operators (`++`, `--`)
    -   [x] `if / else` statements
    -   [x] `for` loops
    -   [x] `while` loops
    -   [x] block statements for scope (`{ ... }`)
    -   [x] Output with `print` statements
    -   [x] Code comments (`/* this is a comment */`)
    -   [x] Bytecode generation
    -   [x] Virtual machine to interpret bytecode
    -   [x] Functions
    -   [ ] Function and loop control flow (`break`, `continue`, `return`)
    -   [ ] Structs and implementation block
    -   [ ] Native data structures (e.g., lists, maps)
    -   [ ] Constant folding

## Grammar

```text
program                  -> function_declaration* EOF

type                     -> function_type | primitive_type
primitive_type           -> bool | num | str
function_type            -> ( [type [, type]*] ) -> type

variable_declaration     -> identifier : type = expression ;

parameter                -> identifer: type
function_declaration     -> def identifier ( [parameter [, parameter]*]? ) (-> type)? block_statement

block_statement          -> {
                           expression_statement
                         | print_statement
                         | if_statement
                         | while_statement
                         | for_statement
                         | block_statement
                         | variable_declaration }

expression_statement     -> expression ;

print_statement          -> print ( expression ) ;

if_statement             -> if expression block_statement [else [if_statement | block_statement]]?

while_statement          -> while expression block_statement

for_statement            -> for variable_declaration ; expression ; expression block_statement

expression               -> assignment | logic_or

assignment               -> identifier = expression

logic_or                 -> logic_and [|| logic_and]*

logic_and                -> equality [&& equality]*

equality                 -> comparison [[!= | ==] comparison]*

comparison               -> term [[> | >= | < | <=] term]*

term                     -> factor [[+ | -] factor]*

factor                   -> prefix_unary [[* | /] prefix_unary]*

prefix_unary             -> [! | -] unary | primary

primary                  -> number_literal
                         | string_literal
                         | boolean_literal
                         | postfix_unary
                         | ( expression )

postfix_unary            -> [identifier [++ | --]? | function_call]

function_call            -> callee [(expression [, expression]*)]*
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (>= 1.70)
-   Cargo (comes bundled with Rust)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd kaori
    ```
